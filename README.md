# Popsicle Fire Analysis

This project analyzed the burn distance of popsicle sticks when soaked in different accelerants. The analysis uses the Skillings-Mack procedure for arbitrary incomplete random block designs and introduces a novel procedure for pairwise multiple comparisons against arbitrary incomplete random block design data as a post-hoc test.
